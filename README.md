# AutoMessage


Spigot plugin: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/automessage.372/

NOTE: This is not an official repo for the plugin, it is a customised version for my own use. 

If you want a compiled version discord me at Caleb Britannia#0001

The only difference is the ability to add clickable URL links!
